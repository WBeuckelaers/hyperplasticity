# hyperplasticity

This project provides numerical implementations of models derived in the hyperplasticity framework. The models are largely based on the hyperplasticity course from G.T. Houlsby (https://hyperplasticity.wordpress.com/) and the book *Principles of Hyperplasticity* by G.T. Houlsby and A.M. Puzrin (2006).

The table below gives an overview of the content in this project with links to the slide numbers of the hyperplasticity course and to chapter numbers in the book.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.
The code is written in python and also using Jupyter notebooks

### Prerequisites

__Python__ and __Jupyter__ are prerequisites for running and editing the code. We strongly recommend following the instructions in the link below for the installation.

http://jupyter.org/install

### Running and editing the code
Once Python and Jupyter are set up on your computer, you can run and edit the coded examples. For instructions, follow the link below:
